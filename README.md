# Learning Data Engineering

## Project Description:
This project is another gentle piece of addition to our DE learning path but this time, not code :sunglasses: :sunglasses:. Okay, with this I'll be giving my `sincerest and realest` reviews of some **data-engineering-centered** books (really just some, 'cause I've read a lot :notebook_with_decorative_cover: :book: :open_book: :books:).

These selected books would be *"very very good"* for begineers, *"very good"* for early-intermediates and *"just good"* for experts who maybe wants to write a book of theirs too. So there we have them:

## Please Read This Too (Disclaimer):
Everything I will be passing-across is entirely a biased-opinion based off my own experience, it is not authorised by any body(s)/organization(s) nor is it for any kind of promotion or business thingy.

Also, I am recommending these books beacause they are all fine books :smiley: and worth the read, so any not-so-nice remark does'nt make it not-worthwhile (just it itch kinda).

I should also say, keep in mind that these books are not skill-domain like an Airflow or Sparkfocused book, it a collection of a books teaching the job roles of a data engineer with an overall view of the required skill set. What I am saying is, it does nothing in-depth.

My recommendation paradigm would contain:
- it :+1::+1:,
- it :-1::-1:,
- and a better approach to readinging the book for effectiveness :brain:.
