# Learning Data Engineering

## Project Description:
This project is another gentle piece of addition to our DE learning path but this time, not code :sunglasses: :sunglasses:. Okay, with this I'll be giving my `sincerest and realest` reviews of some **data-engineering-centered** books (really just some, 'cause I've read a lot :open_book: :books:).

These selected books would be **very very good** for begineers, **very good** for early-intermediates and **just good** for experts who maybe wants to write a book of theirs too. So there we have them:

## Please Read This Too (Disclaimer):
Everything I will be passing-across is entirely a biased opinion based on my own experience, it is not authorised by any body(s)/organization(s) nor is it for any kind of promotion or business thingy.

Also, I am recommending these books beacause they are all fine books :smiley: and worth the read, so any not-so-nice remark I make does not make it not-worthwhile.

> I should also say, keep in mind that these books are not skill-specific like an Airflow or Spark focused book, it a collection of a books teaching the job roles of a data engineer with an overall view of the required skill set. What I am saying is, it does nothing in-depth.

My recommendation paradigm would contain:
- it :+1::+1:,
- it :-1::-1:,
- and a better approach to readinging the book for effectiveness :brain: :brain:.

## What Would I Be Reading Next And You Should Too:

This is a new one of june 2022, this book on a little preview by myself, comments, reactions and discussion on LinkedIn; it does seems like a perfect book to get an high level understanding of Data Engineering. It a complete discussion on the paradigms, methodologies, skill-set, job role and the future of DE. I can't just wait to consume it knowledge already.

Want to race me at it??? send your reviews regarding it to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oluwatobi-giwa-806626154/) or a email at my [Gmail](oluwatobitobias@gmail.com), let see who finish first.

Do actually take your time with the reading, ain't nobody racing anybody :rofl: :rofl:, but I will still love your feedback just anytime. Gracias.
