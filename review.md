## Data Engineering with Python
![Data Engineering with Python](/assets/Data%20Engineering%20with%20Python.jpg)

I so much love this book probably beacause it was the first book that got my feet started on data enginnering in code OR the book is just worth loving.
### :+1: :+:
- Brings you up on DE with python as promised, if you have at least a month with python you are fine to consume everything detail by detail.
- Introduces the following topics to 100% clarity for begineers:
    - reading and writing to files,
    - working with databases (Postgres),
    - using Faker to generate fake data to work with,
    - easy to follow installation and use of Airflow, Nifi, Elasticsearch, Postgres,
    - DE methodologies like cdata leaning, transforming, data validation in simple terms with code,
    - some production level things with data pipline for intermediates,
    - introduces the big guns of big data, Spark and kafka with easy code to understand.

It really boils down to coding with python as promised, so yes, with this book, you will be scripting like a data engineer.

### :-1: :-1:
Now to the part i do not like:
- the book introduces both Apache Airflow and Nifi for orchestration but drops Airflow in the first section and followed up with Nifi. I guess Paul really want to make it easy but Nifi is really not used and people don't talk much about it. It is supposed to be GUI based, so yes, Paul was right, it is easy to learn and use but... it just does'nt feel right.
- Paul Crickard also taught us how to use Elasticsearch which is a NoSQL database with Kibana for visualization, but for me, I was lost with Elasticsearch and Cassandra has more hype for open-source NoSQL database. Kibana, I also did'nt dig with it much.

See, the book is that good, I have only just two probs with it, period.

### How you should approach it :brain:
The book is in three section;
 - beginners, 
    - if your python is good enough, finish up section one.
    - skip section two for laters, filled with Nifi and production-level pipeline stuff.
    - only do section three if you are ready for Spark and Kafka, but really it would not be enough to know enough, try Youtube or specifically-focused books for this two beasts.
    - skip anything Nifi, Elasticsearch and Kibana if your heart feels so (mine did).

- not-a-beginner,
    - do section one and three, if you like Nifi (I don't), go ahead with section two.
    - skip anything Nifi, Elasticsearch and Kibana if your heart feels so (mine did).
