# RECOMMENDATION:

## Beginners with Data Engineering:
This is how I'll preach learning data engineering in code and theory:

- Start with Paul Crickard's book (Data engineering with Python) but just section one.
    - if only and only you like Apache Nifi, follow with his section two (but I don't recommend it).
    - do not touch section three just yet, if you do, do not have the confident you know Spark and Kakfa well with just that alone.

- Secondly, read and practice along with all chapters of Data Pipelines Pocket Reference by James Densmore (at least till chapter 8).

- Read all chapters of Fundamentals of Data Engineering by Joe Reis & Matt Housley anytime you don't want to code, read it as a chill. The book tells the life you will be getting with this new career journey.

- Lastly, "97 Things Every Data Engineer Should Know", the insights and lessons told by industry expert in this book is hugely recommended. It a book worthwhile.

Well, that is all I have to say, I do hope my recommendations makes your learning journey more efficient and effective. Thanks.
